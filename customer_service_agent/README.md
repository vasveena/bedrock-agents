# Lab 7.1 - Building Agents for Bedrock using AWS Console

## Overview
This lab will demonstrate how to create your first agent for Bedrock using the AWS console.
It demonstrates how to:
1. Select the underlying foundation model (FM) for your agent 
2. Provide a clear and concise agent instruction 
3. Create an action group with an API Schema and a Lambda function 
4. Test and deploy your agent

This folder contains the API schema, AWS Lamdbda function and SQLite database required for the use case.
You can find detailed instructions on how to create the Agent using the AWS console on the [Bedrock Workshop](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/a4bdb007-5600-4368-81c5-ff5b4154f518/en-US/90-agents)
